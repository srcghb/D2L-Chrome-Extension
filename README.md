# D2L-Chrome-Extension
D2L = DST to Light.gg

This chrome extension swaps the Destiny Stat Tracker (DST) link of each item in Destiny Item Manager (DIM) with it's Light.gg page. 

Note: For this work between consistently, you must click off each item before viewing a new item. This allows the script to refresh and work for the new item opened in DIM.
